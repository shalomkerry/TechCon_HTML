        <h3>Early Beginnings</h3>
        <p>
          TechCon, which stands today as one of the most prominent technology
          conferences globally, began its journey in the early 2000s as a small
          gathering of tech enthusiasts and pioneers. Back then, the conference
          was primarily a platform for startups and emerging tech companies to
          showcase innovations in computing, software development, and emerging
          internet technologies. It was humble in scale but bold in vision.
